      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I’m a first-generation American, born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, now based in New Jersey, with a lifelong curiosity about how systems work and how they can work better for people, shaped by firsthand experience with systems, like private healthcare, that aren’t always designed for everyone.</p>
      <p>I studied computer science in college and found myself drawn to both the structure of development and the flexibility of design. Over time, I realized I wasn’t interested in tech for tech's sake. I was drawn to projects that intersected with care, communication, and access.</p>
      <p>I’ve worked on digital tools in healthcare and behavioral health, most recently at a remote patient monitoring company where I provided technical support, maintained systems, and helped bridge gaps between clinicians, platforms, and patients. I also designed and launched a public-facing DBT flashcards website that blends accessibility, visual clarity, and mental health education into one project.</p>
      <p>Outside of tech, I’ve always had a strong visual side. I make expressive illustrations, digital tools with hand-drawn elements, and small sculptural pieces that explore mental health themes. Art helps me make systems feel warmer and more personal.</p>
      <p>This year, I’m beginning formal training as a peer support specialist. It feels like a natural extension of the work I already do. Whether I’m debugging a tool or illustrating a skill, I care most about building things that help people feel understood, supported, and seen.</p>
